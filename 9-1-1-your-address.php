<p>The <a href="https://gis.hamiltontn.gov" target="_blank">Hamilton County Geospatial Technology Department</a> has been tasked to find and fix pre-existing address issues as well as assign new addresses throughout Hamilton County (except within the city limits of Soddy-Daisy). GIS works in partnership with the Hamilton County 9-1-1 District on this long-term project.</p>

<p>The primary reason for any change to an address or street name will always be personal safety. Problems can manifest in many ways, such as a number out of sequence, an odd number on the even side of the road, duplicate street names with matching block numbers in diverse locations throughout the county, or perhaps a letter &#39;A&#39; or &#39;B&#39; in the number. Many people think there will be no problem finding them in an emergency, but the truth is, nobody deserves to find out the hard way.</p>
