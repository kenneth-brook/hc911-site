                                <h4 class="question cushycms" title="Question">What kind of hours or shifts can I expect to work as a Telecommunicator?</h4>
                                <div class="answer cushycms" title="Answer"><p>We work five, 8-hour shifts totaling 40 hours a week, with rotating off days. As an extremely important, irreplaceable link in public safety, our positions must be staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Mandatory overtime can be implemented. Good attendance and willingness to work hours other than day shift are vital.</p>

<p>Telecommunicators are subject to work ANY shift (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), holidays, and weekends. Shift assignments are semi-permanent (based upon seniority) and new hires must accept that it may be years before they accumulate enough seniority to obtain a day (1st) shift assignment.</p>

However, due to the nature of the position, the shifts are sedentary with periods of high stress, multi-tasking, and downtime. The position demands excellent communications skills, as well as individual and team approaches to problem solving throughout the shift. Policies and procedures are established and enforced to provide the highest level of public safety service.</p>
