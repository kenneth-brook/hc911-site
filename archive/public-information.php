What questions may be asked? Or the reason for all the questions? </p>
                            <p>Having a basic understanding of the emergency response system helps take some of the stress away. Ultimately this helps us to help you during an emergency. See our <a href="tips-guidelines.php">9-1-1 tips and guidelines</a>. </p>
                            <p>Hamilton County 9-1-1 uses the national 9-1-1 mascot, Red. E. Fox and 9-1-1forKids's program to help us educate young children (pre-school through 2nd grade) to learn the differences between problems and emergencies and when to call 9-1-1. Find out more about our programs for children <a href="9-1-1-for-kids.php">here</a>. </p>
                            
                            <p>For older children and adults, we partner with local emergency response agencies to focus more on prevention and answering more complex questions regarding 9-1-1 services, such as texting to 9-1-1, identifying medical, fire and law enforcement emergencies, and the importance of proper addressing.</p>
                            <p>Our Public Education and Outreach not only focuses on what to do during an emergency but also on ways you can help keep yourself and your family safe.</p>
