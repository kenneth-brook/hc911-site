                            <p>The <a href="http://gis.hamiltontn.gov" target="_blank">Hamilton County Geographic Information Services (GIS) Department</a> has been tasked to find and fix pre-existing address issues as well as assign new addresses throughout Hamilton County (except within the city limits of Soddy-Daisy). GIS works in partnership with the Hamilton County 9-1-1 District on this long-term project.</p>

                            <p>The primary reason for any change to an address or street name will always be personal safety. Problems can manifest in many ways, such as a number out of sequence, an odd number on the even side of the road, duplicate street names with matching block numbers in diverse locations throughout the county, or perhaps a letter 'A' or 'B' in the number. Many people think there will be no problem finding them in an emergency, but the truth is, nobody deserves to find out the hard way.</p>
